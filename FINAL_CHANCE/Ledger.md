## Session 1 — 2026-09-18

**Bridge Theorem attempted:**
Capture-or-radius-3 bridge.  Let C be an arbitrary hypothetical primitive positive
non-trivial ordinary Collatz cycle, rooted at its least odd state and satisfying
full-D ownership.  After the inherited count/frontier reductions, at least one
of the following must hold:

1. an ownership-preserving reduction/descent sends C into the exact ordered
   genuine g=2, Z0>0, K<0 parent
   (a,ell)=(217976794617,137528045312), preserving the hypotheses needed by
   the RL343--RL349 full physical bridge, so its forced phase-potential-
   nondecreasing return either descends below the least state or belongs to
   O_75; or
2. the parity word of C has two cyclic rotations at adjacent-transposition
   distance at most 3, in the scope of the already-proved primitive/full-D
   radius-3 obstruction.

Thus, if O_75 is empty, the two alternatives would jointly force a
contradiction for an arbitrary hypothetical positive non-trivial cycle.

**Attack attempted:**
The rejected opening attempt merely assigned a formal object to an unbridged
branch; that was not a construction.  Reopening Session 1, I attacked the g=1
first-survivor branch with an explicit word at the actual inherited scale.

Set
A=217976794617, L=137528045312, b_j=floor(Aj/L).
Define h_2=h_4=1 and h_j=0 otherwise, and define the accelerated exponents
a_j=(b_(j+1)-b_j)+h_j-h_(j+1).
The first values are
b=(0,1,3,4,6,7,9,11,12,14,...) and
a=(1,1,2,1,2,2,2,1,2,1,...).
All a_j are positive.  The resulting binary word has length A and weight L,
so gcd(A,L)=1 makes it primitive.  Its odd-prefix positions are
S_j=b_j-h_j; hence every proper prefix satisfies S_j<=b_j and the inherited
floor lock gives 2^(S_j)<3^j.  Consequently its positive rational affine
cycle is strictly least-rooted.  It is a fully specified g=1 object, outside
the current g=2 parent, satisfying the inherited count/primitivity/least-root
geometry before ordinary ownership is imposed.

This word is obtained from the zero-defect mechanical word by moving the ones
at positions 3 and 6 one place left.  Using
s=114208327604, t=72057431991 with sL-tA=1 and
q=65470613321 with qA=1 (mod L), the exact cyclic transport calculation gives
rotation distances 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 for determinant residues k=1,...,8.
Every other rotation is at least 5 by the mechanical-distance bound and the
triangle inequality.  Therefore the exact minimum all-rotation radius is 5:
the closed radius-3 theorem does not reject this object.

The remaining full-D ownership condition was then tested exactly.  Writing
rho_j=2^(b_j)/3^j, the candidate numerator satisfies
Q_h/D = (sum rho_j - 68/81)/(3(2^A/3^L-1)).
The mechanical sum was evaluated by the exact Euclidean recursion
F(m,n;x,y)=sum_(j=0)^(m-1) x^j y^floor(nj/m),
F(m,n;x,y) =
[1+(y-1)(x/y)(F(n,r;x^q y,x)-1)-y^(n-1)x^m]/(1-x)
for m=qn+r, with directed 160-digit interval arithmetic.
It gives
36797780658427066316156.3903948169381259690550430756327299785479
< Q_h/D <
36797780658427066316156.3903948169381259690550430756327299785480.
Hence Q_h/D is not an integer and D does not divide Q_h.  The explicit
countermodel attempt therefore fails exactly at ordinary full-D ownership.

A structural subcase also closes.  If a g=1 nonnegative defect profile has
sum_j h_j=1, its word is one adjacent swap from the mechanical word.  The
mechanical determinant-one rotation has distance 1, so the triangle inequality
puts that owned candidate within distance at most 3 of one of its rotations.
The closed primitive/full-D radius-3 theorem excludes it.  Therefore every
genuine g=1 owner at this first survivor must have defect area at least 2.
The area-2 word above proves that least-root/nonnegative-defect geometry alone
already permits radius 5.  RL153's F_1=1 factor collapse leaves the full
one-block congruence D|Q_h as the unresolved owner datum; no existing
factor/carry/local-radius theorem reduces it for arbitrary area>=2 profiles.

**Outcome:** SURVIVED

**Strike this session:** Y — the rejected opening attempt did not complete a
genuine attack; it substituted a scope restatement/formal branch assignment
for the required construction or impossibility argument.

**Cumulative strikes:** 1/3

**Local work done (if any) and its stated connection to the Bridge Problem:**
none; all finite arithmetic above was used directly to attack the stated
Bridge Theorem, not to tighten O_75 or Phase 4.

**Carry-forward for next session:**
Do not begin Session 2 here.  The surviving point of attack is exact ordinary
ownership in g=1 defect-area>=2 profiles: either force D not to divide Q_h
uniformly, or construct a full-D-owned radius>=4 profile.  The area-1 class is
now removed from that search.


## Session 1 numerical-method correction — 2026-09-18

This addendum corrects the computational wording in Session 1 without changing
its mathematical outcome, strike, or carry-forward.

The integers
`2^A`, `3^L`, `D=2^A-3^L`, and `Q_h` were **not** materialized.  At
`A=217976794617`, `2^A` alone has about 65.6 billion decimal digits.  The
previous phrases "tested exactly", "exact quotient", and "independently
reproduced" were therefore too strong.

The normalized quotient was evaluated through
[
 Q_h/D =
 \frac{\sum_{j=0}^{L-1}\rho_j 2^{-h_j}}
      {3(\exp(\Delta)-1)},\qquad
 \rho_j=2^{\lfloor Aj/L\rfloor}/3^j,quad
 \Delta=A\log 2-L\log 3.
]
The Beatty sum was reduced by Euclidean recursion, so the computation never
contains an object of length `A` or `L`.  The recurrence printed in the
original Session 1 entry was a transcription error.  For
[
 F(m,n;x,y)=\sum_{j=0}^{m-1}x^j y^{\lfloor nj/m\rfloor},
]
first reduce `n=q m+r` by
[
 F(m,n;x,y)=F(m,r;xy^q,y).
]
For `0<n<m`, writing `m=q n+r` and `r>0`, the recurrence actually used
for the recheck is
[
 F(m,n;x,y)=
 \frac{1-a+(y-1)a\left(
 F\!\left(n,r;\frac1{yx^q},\frac1x\right)-1\right)}
      {1-x},
 \qquad a=y^{n-1}x^m,
]
with the divisible case `r=0` handled by the corresponding finite geometric
sum.

A fresh outward-rounded interval computation at 100 decimal digits, repeated
at 120 digits as a stability check, gives for the Session 1 profile
`h_2=h_4=1`
[
36797780658427066316156.3903948169381259690550430756327299785479312583941924522984
< Q_h/D
]
and
[
Q_h/D <
36797780658427066316156.3903948169381259690550430756327299785479312583941924531107.
]
The width of this 100-digit enclosure is less than `8.13e-55`.  Thus the
reported decimal is a high-precision interval estimate, not a directly
computed giant-integer quotient.  The entire interval stays more than
`0.3903` from the nearest integer, so the numerical conclusion
`D \nmid Q_h` is robust to the stated enclosure error.

The radius claim was also not obtained by enumerating the
`A`-bit word or all `A` rotations.  It was inferred from the inherited
Christoffel/mechanical cyclic-transport identity plus the fact that the
profile differs from the mechanical word by two adjacent left swaps.  In
that model the mechanical determinant-residue classes `k=1,...,8` have
baseline transport distances `1,...,8`; evaluating the four sparse moved
endpoints gives the corresponding predicted distances `5,...,12`, while
the triangle inequality gives lower bound `>=5` for every class whose
mechanical distance is `>=9`.  Hence the transport model pins the minimum
at 5.  This is an analytic sparse-transport inference using small modular
integers, not a direct giant-word verification; there is no floating-point
rounding term in that small-integer transport step, but its validity is
conditional on the inherited transport identity rather than on exhaustive
enumeration.

## Session 2 — 2026-09-18

**Bridge Theorem attempted:**
First-survivor `g=1` area-collapse bridge.  Let a hypothetical primitive
positive ordinary Collatz cycle have full counts
[
(A,L)=(217976794617,137528045312),\qquad \gcd(A,L)=1,
]
be rooted at its least odd state, and have the inherited nonnegative defect
excursion
[
h_j=\lfloor Aj/L\rfloor-S_j.
]
If full ordinary ownership `D=2^A-3^L \mid Q_h` holds, then
[
\sum_{j=0}^{L} h_j \le 1.
]
Combined with the inherited radius-one exclusion for area zero and the
Session 1 radius-three argument for area one, this theorem would eliminate
the entire first-survivor `g=1` branch.

**Attack attempted:**
Area two was attacked directly.

Because `h_j` is a nonnegative integer excursion, rises by at most one, and
starts and ends at zero, total area two cannot contain height two: reaching
height two already requires a preceding positive phase, giving area at least
three.  Therefore every area-two profile is exactly a two-spike profile
[
h_p=h_q=1
]
at two phases, with all other `h_j=0`, subject to the ordinary positivity
condition on the adjacent accelerated exponents.

Put
[
S=\sum_{j=0}^{L-1}\rho_j,\qquad
\rho_j=2^{\lfloor Aj/L\rfloor}/3^j.
]
Every two-spike profile has
[
\frac{Q_{p,q}}D=
\frac{S-(\rho_p+\rho_q)/2}{3(\exp(\Delta)-1)}.
]
Thus area-two ownership is an explicit two-term arithmetic target rather than
an unstructured word search.

As a witness search, the first 1000 phases contain 584 admissible isolated
spike locations.  All `170236=binom(584,2)` pairs were screened numerically
at 90 decimal digits only to select the strongest near-integer candidate;
that screen is exploratory evidence, not a proof about the full area-two
family.  The closest candidate in that screen was
[
p=498,\qquad q=972.
]
Here
[
b_{498}=789,\qquad b_{972}=1540,
]
and the preceding mechanical increments satisfy
[
c_{497}=2,\qquad c_{971}=2.
]
Hence the modified accelerated exponents remain positive:
[
a_{497}=1, a_{498}=2,qquad
a_{971}=1, a_{972}=3,
]
with all other exponents equal to their mechanical values.  This is therefore
a concrete valid area-two nonnegative-defect object.

For this object,
[
\frac{Q_{498,972}}D =
\frac{S-2^{788}/3^{498}-2^{1539}/3^{972}}
     {3(\exp(\Delta)-1)}.
]
The same Euclidean Beatty recursion and outward-rounded 100-decimal interval
arithmetic used in the Session 1 correction gives
[
36797780658465232971971.9999989856644225955131181871237550300443905896826815483422290651487527740866811037
< Q_{498,972}/D
]
and
[
Q_{498,972}/D <
36797780658465232971971.9999989856644225955131181871237550300443905896826815491544330262718501145951158979.
]
The enclosure width is less than `8.13e-55`.  Its distance from the next
integer is greater than
[
1.0143355774044868818128762449699556\times 10^{-6}.
]
Therefore this explicit area-two near-hit still fails ordinary ownership by a
margin roughly `10^{48}` times larger than the numerical enclosure width.
No giant integer `D` or `Q` was constructed.

No area-two owner was found.  This does not prove the area-collapse theorem;
it is a genuine failed construction attempt against it.  The useful reduction
gained this session is that the whole area-two attack is now the two-spike
equation above.

**Outcome:** SURVIVED

**Strike this session:** N — a concrete falsifiable bridge theorem was stated
and directly attacked with an explicit valid area-two object; no new
local-to-global lemma was substituted for the attack.

**Cumulative strikes:** 1/3

**Local work done (if any) and its stated connection to the Bridge Problem:**
none; the two-spike reduction and near-hit computation directly attack the
`g=1` Bridge Theorem.

**Carry-forward for next session:**
Do not repeat finite pair screening as a substitute for a theorem.  Attack the
two-spike ownership equation globally: either prove no admissible pair
`(p,q)` can make the normalized quotient integral, or produce a genuinely
owned pair.  If that route structurally fails, state the obstruction before
moving to area at least three.


## Session 1 / Session 2 verifier-artifact addendum — 2026-09-18

Both sessions remain at their recorded **SURVIVED** status, but are classified
here as **ATTEMPTED, PENDING THIRD-PARTY VERIFICATION**.  This addendum does
not advance to Session 3.

The computational claims are now backed by runnable repository artifacts:

- `FINAL_CHANCE/verifiers/verify_session1_interval.py`
  (introduced by commit `99671230c0a6b16e74d292ed71351739753e626b`);
- `FINAL_CHANCE/verifiers/verify_session2_two_spike_screen.py`
  (introduced by commit `ddd3309f790aa54cbdbd749eae221374de055f46`).

Both require only the Python standard library.  Neither materializes
`2^A`, `3^L`, `D`, or the full numerator.  The Session 1 script uses
exact rational atanh-series bounds for `ln 2` and `ln 3`, an exact rational
Taylor/remainder bound for `exp(Delta)-1`, and outward-rounded Decimal
interval arithmetic for the Euclidean Beatty recursion.  Session 2 imports
that same machinery and applies outward intervals to every one of the 170,236
admissible two-spike pairs in the stated `p,q<=1000` screen.

The verifier-produced decimal tails below supersede the earlier handwritten
interval tails in the Session 1 correction and Session 2 entry.  The
mathematical conclusions are unchanged.

Session 2's screen therefore contains no interval that meets an integer, and
the nearest screened miss is `(498,972)`; its certified miss interval is
strictly separated from the second-place pair.  This remains only a finite
screen of `p,q<=1000`, not a theorem for all area-two profiles.

No Session 3 work has begun.


## Independent-audit repair addendum — 2026-09-18

Sessions 1 and 2 remain **SURVIVED** and remain **ATTEMPTED, PENDING
THIRD-PARTY RE-VERIFICATION OF THE REPAIRED ARTIFACTS**.  No Session 3 work
has begun.

An independent audit of the first committed verifier versions returned
`VERIFIED WITH NON-MATERIAL CORRECTIONS` for both numerical conclusions,
but identified verification-integrity defects in the repository artifacts:

1. `Decimal.__pow__` is not guaranteed correctly rounded in every case, so
   the old `ipow` implementation did not by itself prove outward containment.
2. The Session 2 filter omitted 415 admissible adjacent-spike profiles, making
   the correct `p,q<=1000` count 170651 rather than 170236.
3. Nearest-integer distance subtractions were occurring in the default
   28-digit Decimal context.
4. The old closest-pair assertion compared the winner only with the pair having
   the second-smallest upper bound rather than with the minimum lower bound
   over the entire remaining field.
5. No RL20-style verifier exists for the Session 1 radius-5 claim.

The independent audit separately recomputed the ownership quotient with a
different exact-integer/binary interval implementation and found the Session 1
quotient strictly inside the old printed interval.  It also screened the 415
omitted Session 2 profiles and found no owner; the closest pair remained
`(498,972)` and the second closest remained `(431,549)`.  Those facts
motivated repairs but do not substitute for the repository artifacts below.

### Repairs committed

`FINAL_CHANCE/verifiers/verify_session1_interval.py` was repaired in commit
`359e73b0fd3f2e805464c200f457910a05dd6c34`.

The verifier now:

- forms integer powers by binary exponentiation through directed interval
  multiplication, never through `Decimal.__pow__`;
- uses explicit directed contexts for interval width and distance-to-integer
  bounds;
- keeps integer-candidate arithmetic in Python integers.

`FINAL_CHANCE/verifiers/verify_session2_two_spike_screen.py` was repaired in
commit `e6e69c9b0e7fa77300b6ec36d9658a3c135966c6`.

The verifier now:

- includes the adjacent case `q=p+1`, for which there is no second rise and
  therefore no requirement `c_(q-1)=2`;
- screens all 170651 admissible pairs with `1<=p<q<=1000`;
- keeps scanning the full field even if an integer-containing interval were
  encountered;
- computes nearest-integer distance bounds with explicit directed rounding;
- proves the winner against the entire field by asserting that its upper
  miss-distance bound is below the minimum lower miss-distance bound of every
  other pair.

The phrases "certified" in the previous verifier-artifact addendum are
superseded by the concrete statement "rigorous outward interval computation";
no such adjective is being used as evidence for the Bridge Problem.

This artifact establishes, subject to third-party execution/review of the

This artifact establishes, subject to third-party execution/review of the
repaired code, that no admissible area-two profile with
`1<=p<q<=1000` has an ownership interval meeting an integer.  It remains a
finite screen only; it does not establish the area-collapse Bridge Theorem or
exclude arbitrary area-two profiles.

### Radius-5 correction

The prior Session 1 sentence "the exact minimum all-rotation radius is 5" is
not treated as verified.  What is presently supported is an analytic
sparse-transport inference conditional on the inherited mechanical transport
identity.  No committed verifier independently establishes the all-rotation
minimum at the RL20 standard.  Until such an artifact exists, radius 5 does
not count as independently verified evidence in FINAL_CHANCE.

### Verification state

- Session 1 outcome remains `SURVIVED`; strike remains `Y`; cumulative
  strikes remain `1/3`.
- Session 2 outcome remains `SURVIVED`; strike remains `N`; cumulative
  strikes remain `1/3`.
- The repaired numerical ownership artifacts are ready for independent
  re-verification.
- Session 3 is not opened.


## Verification acceptance note — 2026-09-18

The user reports that the repaired Session 1 and Session 2 verifier artifacts
have both passed independent verification.  Their previous
`ATTEMPTED, PENDING THIRD-PARTY RE-VERIFICATION` flags are therefore cleared.
Their recorded mathematical outcomes and strikes are unchanged:

- Session 1: `SURVIVED`, strike `Y`;
- Session 2: `SURVIVED`, strike `N`;
- cumulative strikes entering Session 3: `1/3`.

The separately downgraded radius-5 wording remains scoped exactly as recorded:
it is not needed for the Session 3 attack below.

## Session 3 — 2026-09-18

**Bridge Theorem attempted:**
First-survivor `g=1` area-collapse bridge.  Let a hypothetical primitive
positive ordinary Collatz cycle have full counts

[
(A,L)=(217976794617,137528045312),
]

be rooted at its least odd state, satisfy full ordinary ownership
`D=2^A-3^L | Q_h`, and have the inherited nonnegative defect excursion

[
h_j=lfloor Aj/Lfloor-S_j.
]

Then

[
sum_{j=0}^{L} h_j le 1.
]

Together with the inherited zero-defect and area-one radius obstructions,
this would eliminate the entire first-survivor `g=1` branch.

**Attack attempted:**
The carry-forward required a global attack on area two rather than another
bounded pair screen.  Session 3 eliminates the entire defect-area-two layer.

By the Session 2 excursion classification, area two is exactly

[
h_p=h_q=1,qquad 0<p<q<L,
]

with all other defects zero.

Put

[
M=A-L=80448749305,qquad
r_j=Ajmod L.
]

Use the corrected RL157 phase normalization.  For height one,

[
P_h(T)=2(1+T+cdots+T^{L-1})-T^{r_p}-T^{r_q},
]

and ownership is equivalent to

[
P_h(ho)=0pmod D,
]

where (ho) also satisfies

[
2ho^L=1pmod D.
]

Multiplying by (ho-1) collapses the dense geometric part.  Every owned
two-spike profile must therefore satisfy

[
E_{r,s}(ho)=0pmod D,
]

where (r=r_p), (s=r_q), and

[
E_{r,s}(T)=1+(T-1)(T^r+T^s).
]

This is the new global lever: the (L)-term ownership polynomial has become
a five-term polynomial without losing the necessary full-(D) condition.

### 3A. Non-adjacent spikes: global resultant contradiction

If the two spikes are non-adjacent, each is entered from defect zero.  The
excursion grammar therefore requires

[
c_{p-1}=c_{q-1}=2,
qquad
c_j=lfloor A(j+1)/Lfloor-lfloor Aj/Lfloor.
]

Because (A=L+M), the exact residue update shows

[
c_{j-1}=2 iff 1le r_j<M
]

for every proper phase.  Hence for a non-adjacent area-two profile,

[
1le r,s<M.
]

Let

[
B(T)=2T^L-1.
]

The reciprocal of (B) is, up to a unit, the Eisenstein polynomial
(T^L-2); hence (B) is irreducible over (mathbb Q).  Since
(deg E_{r,s}le M<L) and (E_{r,s}
e0),

[
R_{r,s}:=operatorname{Res}(B,E_{r,s})
e0.
]

The simultaneous congruences (B(ho)=E_{r,s}(ho)=0pmod D) imply

[
Dmid R_{r,s}.
]

Now put (alpha=2^{-1/L}) and (m=deg E_{r,s}le M).
The roots of (B) are (alphazeta), (zeta^L=1).  Discrete Parseval
and AM-GM give

[
|R_{r,s}|
le
2^m V_m^{L/2},
]

with

[
V_m
=
1+alpha^2+alpha^4+alpha^{2m-2}+alpha^{2m}.
]

If coefficient cancellation occurs, this only decreases the right-hand side.
For real (x), the logarithmic derivative of
(2^xV_x^{L/2}) is

[
(log 2),
rac{1+alpha^2+alpha^4}{V_x}>0,
]

so the bound is increasing in (m) and is maximal at (m=M).

Since (D>0),

[
2^M>(3/2)^L,
]

hence (alpha^{2M}<4/9).  Also (L>14) gives
(alpha^{-2}=2^{2/L}<10/9).  Therefore

[
V_M<3+rac{4}{9}left(1+rac{10}{9}ight)
=rac{319}{81}.
]

Thus

[
|R_{r,s}|
<
2^M(319/81)^{L/2}
=
2^A(319/324)^{L/2}.
]

The exact finite inequality

[
(319/324)^{1828}<2^{-41},
]

together with (L/2>1828), gives

[
|R_{r,s}|<2^{A-41}.
]

Finally, with

[
Delta=Alog2-Llog3,
]

the exact rational log enclosure in the Session 3 verifier proves

[
Delta>rac1{2^{41}-1}.
]

Since (1-e^{-Delta}>Delta/(1+Delta)),

[
D=2^A(1-e^{-Delta})>2^{A-41}.
]

Therefore

[
0<|R_{r,s}|<D,
]

contradicting (Dmid R_{r,s}).  **No non-adjacent defect-area-two owner
exists.**

### 3B. Adjacent spikes: two global size lifts plus a 52-case residual

It remains to take (q=p+1).

Choose the exact Bezout data

[
P=65470613321,qquad U=103768467013,
]

with

[
AP-UL=1.
]

Put

[
T=L-P=72057431991,qquad
S=A-U=114208327604,
]

so

[
AT-SL=-1.
]

The distinguished phase can be represented both as

[
ho=2^U3^{-P}=3^T2^{-S}pmod D.
]

Also

[
ho^{r_j}=2^{b_j}3^{-j}pmod D,
qquad b_j=lfloor Aj/Lfloor.
]

Clearing powers of (3) in
(1+(ho-1)(ho^{r_p}+ho^{r_q})=0) gives the necessary integer
congruence

[
Dmid N_3,
]

where

[
N_3=
3^{P+q}
+
(2^U-3^P)
left(2^{b_p}3^{q-p}+2^{b_q}ight).
]

The inherited floor lock gives (0<2^{b_j}/3^j<1), while
(1/2<2^U/3^P<1).  Hence

[
0<N_3<3^{P+q}.
]

The same exact log lower bound gives
(D>3^{L-26}).  Therefore every adjacent owner with

[
qle T-26
]

is impossible.

Using the complementary representation and clearing powers of (2) gives

[
Dmid N_2,
]

where

[
N_2=
2^{S+A-b_p}
+
(3^T-2^S)
left(3^{L-p}+3^{L-q}2^{b_q-b_p}ight).
]

Here the complementary normalized phase terms are strictly between zero and
one and (1/2<3^T/2^S<1), so

[
0<N_2<2^{S+A-b_p}.
]

Exact floor arithmetic gives

[
b_{T+26}=S+41.
]

Since (D>2^{A-41}), every adjacent owner with

[
pge T+26
]

is impossible.

Thus only

[
T-26le ple T+25,qquad q=p+1,
]

survive the two analytic size arguments: exactly 52 adjacent pairs.

These 52 are checked by the committed artifact

`FINAL_CHANCE/verifiers/verify_session3_area2_global.py`.

It evaluates the necessary ratio (N_3/D) with the repaired directed
interval machinery.  No interval meets an integer.  The closest residual
pair is

[
(p,q)=(72057432000,72057432001)=(T+9,T+10),
]

for which the reproduced enclosure is

[
65708206692263066.001828087723486399337183400623097221704182119314116522218285438960636764365133134387734154319193925510487833781568851505377
<
N_3/D
]

and

[
N_3/D
<
65708206692263066.001828087723486399337183400623097221704182119314116522218285438960636764365133134387734154319193925510487833781568851505380.
]

Its interval width is at most (3	imes10^{-123}), and its distance from
the nearest integer is greater than

[
0.0018280877234863993371834006230972.
]

Therefore none of the 52 residual adjacent profiles can satisfy (Dmid N_3).

Combining 3A and 3B:

> **Session 3 theorem:** there is no fully owned `g=1` first-survivor
> defect profile of total defect area exactly 2.

This is global over the complete area-two family; it is not a bounded
`p,q` screen.

The verifier also checks all finite constants used by the resultant/size
bounds and the 52 residual intervals.  Its headline output is:

```

**Outcome:** SURVIVED

The Bridge Theorem was not proved: a surviving owned profile could still have
defect area at least 3.  But the attack removes the entire area-two layer,
globally, rather than merely extending the Session 2 finite search.

**Strike this session:** N — the current Bridge Theorem was stated and
attacked directly, and one complete global residual class (all area-two
profiles) was removed.  No new local-to-global bridge was substituted for the
open theorem.

**Cumulative strikes:** 1/3

**Local work done (if any) and its stated connection to the Bridge Problem:**
none.  The resultant collapse, global size bounds, and 52-case residual are
all parts of the direct attack on the stated area-collapse Bridge Theorem.

**Carry-forward for next session:**
Do not continue by merely screening defect area 3, 4, 5, ... one layer at a
time.  The next attack must test whether the ((T-1)P_h) sparse-collapse
mechanism admits a **uniform area>=3/height-independent bound**, or else give
a structural reason it cannot.  The surviving owner class is now exactly
(sum h_jge3).

Session 3 is **ATTEMPTED, PENDING INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION** of the new
analytic argument and `verify_session3_area2_global.py`.  Do not open
Session 4 until that verification state is resolved.


## Session 3 independent verification acceptance — 2026-09-18

The user reports that Session 3 has passed independent verification with verdict
**VERIFIED WITH NON-MATERIAL CORRECTIONS**.  The verified theorem is unchanged:
there is no fully owned `g=1` first-survivor defect profile of total defect area
exactly 2 at
`A=217976794617`, `L=137528045312`.  This is global over the complete
area-two family.  The Session 3 Bridge Theorem itself remains unproved, so the
surviving `g=1` owner class is `sum_j h_j >= 3`.

The independent audit identified three non-material verification-integrity
corrections, recorded here without reopening Session 3:

1. the Session 3 quoted verifier stdout was abridged rather than literally
   complete;
2. the global floor-lock premise is true but was not asserted in the committed
   verifier; the useful exact check is essentially `delta_hi * L < l2_lo`;
3. the Parseval prose should say that coefficient cancellation decreases the
   **Parseval sum / left-hand side**.  The degree `m` and the quantity `V_m`
   remain unchanged because the leading term does not cancel.

These corrections do not alter the Session 3 theorem, outcome, strike, or
carry-forward.  Session 4 is now open under the mandated uniform
height-independent `(X-1)P_h` attack.


## Session 4 — 2026-09-18

**Bridge Theorem attempted:**
Uniform collapsed-Parseval bridge.  For every legal nonnegative first-survivor
`g=1` defect excursion with `sum_j h_j >= 3`, let `H=max h_j`, let
`P_h(X)=sum_(j<L) 2^(H-h_j) X^(Aj mod L)`, and form the exact collapsed
ownership polynomial

```
E_h(X) = 2^(H-1)
         + sum_(ell=1)^H 2^(H-ell) (X-1) F_ell(X),
F_ell(X) = sum_(j: h_j>=ell) X^(Aj mod L).
```

Reduce any `X^L` term with `2X^L-1` to the canonical degree-`<L`
representative, clear only the forced power-of-two denominator, and divide by
integer content.  Write the resulting primitive polynomial as
```
Etilde_h(X)=sum_(k=0)^m e_k X^k,
```
and put `alpha=2^(-1/L)` and
```
V(Etilde_h)=sum_(k=0)^m e_k^2 alpha^(2k).
```
The attempted universal statement was
```
m < L
and
2^m V(Etilde_h)^(L/2) < D,
D=2^A-3^L.
```
If true, ownership would give `D | Res(2X^L-1,Etilde_h) != 0`, while
Parseval/AM-GM would give absolute resultant strictly below `D`, eliminating
all surviving profiles at once.

**Attack attempted:**
The general collapse was derived rather than guessed.  With
`w_j=2^(H-h_j)`, `r_j=Aj mod L`, `P=A^(-1) mod L), and
`sigma(r)=Pr mod L`, write the coefficient of `X^r` in `P_h` as
`a_r=w_(sigma(r))`.  Then
```
(X-1)P_h
 = a_(L-1) X^L - a_0
   + sum_(r=1)^(L-1) (a_(r-1)-a_r) X^r.
```
Thus `X-1` differentiates in residue/exponent order, not chronological
phase order.  Consecutive exponents compare phases separated by
`P=A^(-1) mod L`.

Using
```
2^(H-h_j) = 2^H - sum_(ell=1)^(h_j) 2^(H-ell)
```
and `2 rho^L=1 mod D`, ownership gives exactly
```
E_h(rho)=0 mod D,
E_h(X)=2^(H-1)+sum_(ell=1)^H 2^(H-ell)(X-1)F_ell(X).
```
Equivalently, with
`d_j=2^H-2^(H-h_j)` and
`G_h=sum_(j<L)d_j X^(r_j)`, one has
```
E_h(X)=2^(H-1)+(X-1)G_h(X).
```
If `g_r=d_(sigma(r))`, the coefficients are
`e_0=2^(H-1)`, `e_r=g_(r-1)-g_r` for `1<=r<L`, and
`e_L=g_(L-1)`.  The collapse is therefore a weighted boundary measure in
permuted residue order.

Two structural countermodel families then break the attempted uniform
consequence.

First, at the actual survivor
```
P=A^(-1) mod L = 65470613321,
T=L-P = 72057431991,
c_1=2.
```
For every `3<=N<=P-1`, the single connected height-one excursion
```
h_j=1 for 2<=j<=N+1,
h_j=0 otherwise
```
is legal and has defect area `N`.  If two of its defect residues were
adjacent, their phase separation would be congruent to `+/-P mod L`; but
all positive separations in the interval are at most `N-1<=P-2<P<T`.
Hence every defect residue is isolated in exponent order.  Since the unique
phase of residue `L-1` is `T>P`, no endpoint wrap occurs.  Therefore
```
E_h(X)=1+(X-1) sum_(j=2)^(N+1) X^(r_j)
```
has exactly `2N+1` nonzero coefficients.  At `N=P-1` this is
`130941226641` terms.  So one connected chronological excursion already
produces residue-order complexity growing linearly with defect area.

The first member, `N=3`, has
```
(r_2,r_3,r_4)
=(23369453298,103818202603,46738906596),
```
so
```
deg E_h = 103818202604 > M = 80448749305.
```
Thus the Session 3 `deg E<=M` window fails immediately for a legal connected
area-three profile.

Second, coefficient size is not height-uniform.  The ramp
```
d_j^ramp = floor(Aj/L)-j
```
has increments `c_j-1 in {0,1}`, starts at zero, and reaches `M-1` at
`j=L-1`.  Hence every height `1<=H<=M-1` occurs.  Following the ramp to the
first phase at height `H` and then dropping to zero is legal.  Its primitive
collapse retains constant coefficient `2^(H-1)`: the unique maximum has
weight deficit `2^H-1`, which is odd, while all lower-level deficits are
even, so the power-of-two constant cannot be removed as content.

An explicit height-three member is
```
(h_0,...,h_7)=(0,0,1,1,2,2,3,0),
```
with area nine.  Its five positive-phase deficit weights are
`4,4,6,6,7`, its collapsed polynomial is primitive, has degree below `L`,
and has constant coefficient `4`.  Therefore its Parseval quantity satisfies
`V>=16`, so the exact Session-3-style sufficient upper bound satisfies
```
2^m V^(L/2) >= 16^(L/2) = 2^(2L).
```
But
```
2L=275056090624 > A=217976794617
```
and `D<2^A`.  Hence this Parseval upper bound is already greater than `D`
from the constant term alone.  The attempted universal inequality is false.

These countermodels do not assert full ownership; they disprove the claimed
structural/norm/degree implication from the already-proved excursion grammar,
which is exactly the permitted Session 4 countermodel use.  The exact collapse
identity survives.  What is killed is the promotion of the Session 3
sparse-collapse/degree/Parseval mechanism to a height-independent ownership
contradiction using the presently known defect grammar alone.

The detailed proof is committed at

**Outcome:** KILLED

The attempted uniform collapsed-Parseval Bridge Theorem is false.  More
structurally, the Session 3 `(X-1)P_h` sparse-support, `M`-degree, and
Parseval-norm mechanism cannot be made height/area independent from the
currently known defect excursion grammar.  The reason is the mismatch between
chronological locality and residue-order differentiation.

**Strike this session:** N — Session 4 stated an exact universal bridge,
derived its general collapse, and attacked it directly with parametric and
explicit legal countermodels.  The negative result is the mandated Outcome C,
not a substitute local computation.

**Cumulative strikes:** 1/3

**Local work done and connection to Bridge Problem:**
No unrelated local work.  The committed verifier checks only the exact
arithmetic and grammar facts needed for the direct structural countermodels.
It does not enumerate area-three owners and does not test ownership.

**Carry-forward:**
Do not open Session 5 until this result is independently audited.  If verified,
do not retry the Session 3 sparse/degree/Parseval argument from excursion
grammar alone and do not start area-by-area enumeration.  Any future bridge
using `E_h` must import genuinely new ownership-specific information coupling
phases separated by `P=A^(-1) mod L`, or a genuinely global complementary-lift
mechanism not reducible to the failed residue-order norm/degree bound.

Verification status: **ATTEMPTED, PENDING INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION**.


## Strike-count / Session 4 verification disposition — 2026-09-18

By explicit user instruction, the cumulative FINAL_CHANCE strike count entering
Session 5 is **2/3** across the full FINAL_CHANCE programme.  This supersedes
the `1/3` count written in the Session 4 entry without editing that append-only
historical entry.

The user also accepts the nature of the Session 4 result as a structural
`KILLED` countermodel result and explicitly waives independent verification as
a prerequisite to opening Session 5.  Session 4 is therefore treated as
closed for programme-flow purposes.  Its mathematical scope remains exactly as
stated: the uniform sparse/degree/Parseval consequence from the present defect
grammar is killed; no full-owner countermodel was claimed.

Session 5 is now open at cumulative strikes **2/3**.  If Session 5 incurs a
strike, the count becomes `3/3` and the next session must mechanically file a
STOP verdict under `FINAL_CHANCE/README.md`.
